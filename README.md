# Data-Warehouse-Project
**Building a data warehouse using Microsoft SQL Server**

Welcome!  
This project highlights industry best practices for Data Engineering through the creation of a data warehousing solution using Microsoft SQL Server.

## Project overview
This project involves:

**Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using the Medallion Architecture with Bronze, Silver and Gold layers.  
**ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, Transforming, and Loading data from source systems into the warehouse.  
**Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.  

## Specifications
**Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.  
**Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.  
**Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.  
**Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.  
**Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
